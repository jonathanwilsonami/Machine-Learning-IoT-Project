# Machine-Learning-IoT-Project
This project is for the purpose of exploring and innovating with everything I have been learning or am currently learning in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer Science, Software Engineering, and IoT. The goal is to create a prototype that can potentially create value by solving a real world problem.

## Past Projects
* Domain Knowledge
  * Construction - Building homes and heavy civil
  * Network Engineering
  * Some Cyber Security 
* Machine Learning and Data Science

* Web and API Development
  * [Personal Website](https://github.com/jonwilami323/Personal-Website) - http://jonathanwil.com This is still in development and needs some work. 
  * Network Information Tool (NIT) - This project is private, sensitive, and the property of the BYU Office of Information Technology. Basic description: As a full stack software developer I helped develop a set of REST APIs and web application to aid various groups to monitor and manage the network infrastructure of BYU. The BYU network has thousands of devices from routers to switches that require monitoring and maintenance. This app gets access to data and software on these devices and provides a way for them to be managed and provide metrics on how the network is being used. The APIs do all the heavy lifting while the web application provides a UI for engineers and technicians to facilitate their day-to-day tasks. This was a 3-year endeavor that gave me a wealth of experience in many areas of engineering and development. Technologies, languages, and principles used: FLASK RESTful framework, Vue.JS front end framework, JavaScript, Python, various flavors of SQL, Elasticsearch, Linux scripting, HTML, CSS, AWS, Git, Agile Development, Network protocols such as SNMP, SSH, HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP, and SSL.

## Current Learning objectives

* **IoT** - Start with simple Arduino projects then begin experimenting and exploring with machine learning on IoT devices.    
* **Electronics** - Gain a basic understanding of how to optimize and engineer for Arduino prototyping.  
* **AWS** - Provide the ability to rapidly scale and analyze data using cloud compute.  
* **Containerization** - For running and deploying multiple distributed applications. 
* **Mobile app development** - Manage the application/s from a mobile device. 
* **Security essentials** - Ensure that the device/s and software are locked down and are not vulnerable to hackers.
* **Full stack web development** - Create a web UI for this project. 
* Open and curious mind for more areas of learning as the need arises. 

## Project Ideas
* Car security system powered by small solar panel
* House heat detection system for monitoring home power efficiency
